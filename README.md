# ShambaTimes
A scheduling app for Shambhala Music Festival, available on the play store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shambatimes.schedule

In addition to making a cool scheduling app for Shambhala, ShambaTimes was a way to explore new libraries and API's such as RecyclerView.

A longterm goal I have for the app is to try and make it festival neutral, so anyone could easily upload a schedule into it for whichever festival they like.
